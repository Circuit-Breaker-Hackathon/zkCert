#  ZkCert Front-End Project Overview

ZkCert front-end application, built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript for robust and scalable web development. We've chosen Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach to styling and NextUI for its rich set of UI components, ensuring a responsive and modern interface. The front end allows the user to sign up with eth, anonymously verify with zkemail, comment on scientific papers and more.

## Key Features ðŸ”‘

- **Modern Frameworks**: Built with Next.js 14 for server-side rendering and static generation, ensuring fast page loads and optimal SEO performance.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration for type-safe code, reducing runtime errors and enhancing developer productivity.
- **Stylish UI**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for custom styling and NextUI for ready-to-use components, making the UI sleek and user-friendly.
- **Ethereum Authentication**: Implements Ethereum-based sign-in for a secure and anonymous user authentication process, powered by the Dynamic.xyz library.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL database connected via Vercel for reliable and scalable data storage, managing user data, papers, comments, and more.
- **API Integration**: Seamless API calls from the front end to the database in TypeScript, ensuring smooth data retrieval and management.
- **Privacy-Centric**: Designed to keep user anonymity at the forefront, storing only wallet addresses and employing zkEmail for secure email verification.
